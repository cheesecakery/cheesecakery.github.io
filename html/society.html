                <h3>Joining the <strong>Sir Cheesecake Steak</strong>&trade; society</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    If one would like to join the Sir Cheesecake Steak society there are a number of points one must be clearsighted on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Firstly, it is imperative that you have scored highly on the quiz. Of course, the only way you should be able to access this page is if you have scored highly
                    -- so I presume this point is rendered obsolete. If you have <i>not</i> scored highly, I highly suggest you tab off this page. There is information here only for the
                    brightest of eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, one must have an inbred -- I mean <i>ingrown</i> -- adoration for the values of our society: secrecy, a susceptibility to cult-like behaviour,
                    and most importantly, a love for cheesecake. Not the cheesecake itself, but what the round dessert represents, you know? I think you know. Let me know if you
                    don't know, but I presume you do know. Because, you know.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="about">
                <h3>Benefits of membership</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Of course, it must be said that there are a multitude of benefits to joining our society.
                </p>
                <p>Such benefits include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>20% off at the Cheesecake Factory (& access to the 'secret' menu).</li>
                    <li>A subscription to the society's dearest magazine, the <i>Cheesecake and Early Modern Period and Wine Club Bulletin</i>.</li>
                    <li>Access to the <strong>SCS</strong> library in order to research propaganda relating to HVII, the king supreme.</li>
                    <li>Monthly zoom calls with the rest of the society membership in order to discuss various imperial matters and form life-long bonds
                            with fellows over the internet. It is ever so important in this day and age to strengthen our bonds; we are running out of number.
                    </li>
                    <li>Something to be proud of. </li>
                    <li>A passion.</li>
                    <li>A commitment...!</li>
                    <li>Aren't we all so lonely these days? What is the harm in a little money spent.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="about">
                <h3>The cost</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Can't we discuss this later? We've drilled on about the benefits and such -- really, if you want to be a part of this society, what
                    you must understand is that money is no object. Repeat after me - money is <i>no object</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if you really must know, membership costs £50 each month. We are currently doing a special: a year round deal for the sweet price of £700.
                    In today's economy, that's a steal!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contact Bertrude for the finer details. If your application was successful, expect an ox liver in the mail. Adios!
