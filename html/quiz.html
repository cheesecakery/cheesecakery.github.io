                                    I presume that you have dared to venture on this page with the knowledge that is required. There are several principles I must bestow upon
                                    you if we are to continue to embark on this journey.

                                    Firstly, the importance of <strong>wider reading</strong>. If you feel uncomfortable on the subject of the Lancastrians, Yorkists or Tudors, I would highly suggest
                                    taking a moment or two, a pen and quill or two, and engaging with the subject matter listed below. Remember, this is for your benefit.

                                    You were <strong>correct</strong>. It was this very marriage which allowed my great great-grandson, James VI, to take the throne in 1603 and finally unite the two crowns.

                                    You were <strong>incorrect</strong>. I regret to say that you were very close to a correct answer, but initially, it was my eldest son <i>Arthur</i> who would be betrothed to Katherine.
                                    It was only upon Arthur's far too early death that Henry, and I mean soon-to-be Henry VIII, would encroach on his wife. Funnily enough, Henry had to seek

                                    I regret to inform that you were <strong>incorrect</strong>, and that I was actually married to the Elizabeth of <i>York</i>. I was able to use this marriage for my own

                                    Q3: This question was, as you might have thought, rather vague. What made me respected? This is a question which could be argued to great length
                                    by any scholar of late medieval history for many moons. The answer you gave was, however, largely <strong>incorrect</strong>, as Henry VI
                                    was able to secure no real military victories, despite some effort. After the perils of the Wars of the Roses, the country wanted peace. Any effort
                                    to rally tax for war - on Scotland or France or the like - was strongly rejected, with tax rebellions in Yorkshire and in Cornwall.
